# 📊 Analytics Brainstorm for AirLog Reports

## Based on Your Data Model:
- **Sessions** (with timestamps, status, build version)
- **Scenes** (with descriptions, order)
- **Testers** (with names, email, reported issues)
- **Notes** (with transcripts, categories, timestamps, AI summaries)
- **Poll Questions & Responses** (single/multi-choice)
- **Reported Issues** (custom checkboxes)

## 🔮 Tier 3: Advanced Analytics (May Need AI/Additional Processing)

### Quality & Severity
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Estimated Severity** | AI-derived severity score from transcript content |
| **Actionability Score** | How actionable is each note? |
| **Duplicate Detection** | Similar notes across testers (indicates real issue) |

### Cross-Tester Agreement
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Issue Consensus** | How many testers reported similar issues (validates severity) |
| **Unique vs Repeated Issues** | Deduplicated issue count |
| **Tester Agreement Rate** | Do testers agree on problem scenes? |

### Trends & Themes
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Word Cloud** | Common terms across all notes |
| **Recurring Themes** | AI-extracted common themes |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | Overall tone of feedback (frustrated vs. pleased) |

### Historical (Cross-Session)
| Metric | Description |

## 🎨 Visual Presentation Ideas

### Charts to Add
1. **Pie Chart** - Category breakdown (you have this, make it visual)
2. **Bar Chart** - Notes per scene (horizontal, sorted by bug count)
3. **Stacked Bar** - Category distribution per scene
4. **Timeline** - Notes over session duration
5. **Heatmap** - Scenes × Categories matrix
6. **Radar Chart** - Tester engagement metrics

### New Report Sections
1. **Executive Summary Card** - 4-5 key KPIs at the top
2. **Problem Areas** - Top 3 most problematic scenes
3. **Tester Leaderboard** - Who contributed most
4. **Poll Results** - Visual breakdowns per question
5. **Key Themes** - AI-extracted from all notes

---

## 🚀 Quick Implementation Recommendations

### Start with these (high value, low effort):
1. **Session Duration** - already have timestamps
2. **Tester Participation Stats** - simple counts
3. **Bug Density by Scene** - highlight problem areas
4. **Poll Response Charts** - you have this data, just need visualization
5. **Top Issues Reported** - aggregate `reported_issues`

### Consider adding to schema later:
- `severity` field on notes
- `sentiment_score` computed from AI
- Session-level analytics cache (precomputed stats)
